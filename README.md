# Time-series data analysis and forecasting

## Overview

This is a repository of practice excercises on the topic of time-series forecasting. For now, I explored only non-seasonal ARIMA models.


## Features
Nothing special for now, just comparisons of different methods.

## Setup & Installation
Scripts are written in Python. [Installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is highly recommended. 


## Usage
Just open Jupyter notebooks and you are ready to go.

A html preview of each notebook is available.
